                    <p> I wanted to write this short passage on how I started my company Bayside Bartender. It was early 2019 I had been struggling to find work as Web developer, so I became a ride share driver on the side, when one mid day a passanger jumped in. I realized she was dressed kind of awesone and she had this amazing personality.
                        I asked her "Going to work"? she replied "Yes I am a bartender". I said "That's awesome, I wanted to learn to become a bartender, but the school I wanted to train at costs too much. she then replied "OMG really, that's ridiculous, you don't need to go to school, you just have to teach yourself.
                        so then I said " so...I can just teach my self? I mean I wouldn't even know where to start? Is the licsence expensive? She then sais "Alex the test is super easy and the cost are like $15.00 and all you need to do is buy bartending tools". I honestly had no idea what she was talking about but I was interested tho.
                        She then saids "Alex this is a Jigger and you can measure liquor with this, Good Luck"!
                        I shouted Thanks!! as she rushed into her bar. And after much trial and error, I worked at gigs being a bartender for a full year and after much doubt in 2021 I fully launched Bayside Bartender.
